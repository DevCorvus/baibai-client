A React application for the [Baibai API (demo)](https://github.com/DevCorvus/baibai-api) with Vite.js, TailwindCSS, daisyUI, Zod and Zustand.

> **Baibai** is a demo application where people can post items for sale but also buy those of others (kinda). Pretty much like an e-commerce.

You are free to explore and use the code at your convenience. I hope you find it useful and thanks for reading. ❤️

## Development

Initially, the Baibai project started with the combination of Angular for the frontend and NestJS for the backend respectively, being a project focused on learning new technologies for me and that are related in their architecture. However, during the early development stage and after learning and putting into practice the fundamentals of Angular, I decided to replace Angular with React in order to speed up development and focus on the backend. Taking advantage of this turn to React (where I already have a lot of experience), I added some libraries like daisyUI and Zustand to the formula to learn something new, from which I have obtained very good results and I plan to continue using them. The user interface is simple but the new development iterations I do with React feel more and more refined at the code level and I am proud of those improvements.
